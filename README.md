Wasabi - A Web Framework
========================

*Description*
A Web Framework built with [Kotlin](http://kotlin.jetbrains.org) for the JVM. 

Wasabi combines the expressivness of Kotlin, with the power of Netty and the simplicity of Express.js (and other Sinatra-inspired web frameworks)
to provide an easy to use HTTP framework

*What it is*
An HTTP framework that allows you to easily create back-end services for a web application or any other type of application that 
might require an HTTP API.

*What it is not*
It is not an MVC framework. There is no View Engine or templating language. You can combine it with client-side frameworks such 
as AngularJS or Ember. If you want a fully-fledged MVC framework in Kotlin, take a look at [Kara](http://www.karaframework.com)

*Current Status*
In development. 

Getting Started
---------------

###The Hello World of Wasabi

  server.get("/", { response.send("Hello World!") }
  
  server.start()
```
